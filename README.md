# BitcoinPrice
This Python project fetches the current Bitcoin price via an API and converts it into the three major global currencies: US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and British Pound (GBP). 

For the front-end, the Tkinter library was used to display the converted price in a graphical widget, offering a simple and intuitive interface for viewing the information.
